# Infinite Types in Java and scala

JLS 9:
> It is possible that the lub() function yields an infinite type. This is permissible, and a compiler for the Java programming language must recognize such situations and represent them appropriately using cyclic data structures.
> The possibility of an infinite type stems from the recursive calls to lub(). Readers familiar with recursive types should note that an infinite type is not the same as a recursive type.

JLS 9:
> Like lub (ยง4.10.4), upward projection and downward projection may produce infinite types, due to the recursion on type variable bounds.
