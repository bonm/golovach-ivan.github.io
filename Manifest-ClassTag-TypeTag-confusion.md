# Manifest/ClassManifest/ClassTag/TypeTag Confusion

## java.lang.Class<T>
- know some type signatures of class, no run-time representation
- jackson pattern
  
## Scala 2.7.2: Manifest / ClassManifest / OptManifest / NoManifest 



> Starting with version 2.7.2, Scala has added manifests, an undocumented (and still experimental) 
> feature for reifying types. They take advantage of a pre-existing Scala feature: implicit parameters.

> The only remaining question is how to implement generic array creation. Unlike
> Java, Scala allows an instance creation new Array[T] where T is a type parameter. How can this be
> implemented, given the fact that there does not exist a uniform array representation in Java? The only
> way to do this is to require additional runtime information which describes the type T. Scala 2.8 has a
> new mechanism for this, which is called a Manifest. **An object of type Manifest[T] provides complete
> information about the type T. Manifest values are typically passed in implicit parameters; and the compiler
> knows how to construct them for statically known types T. There exists also a weaker form named
> ClassManifest which can be constructed from knowing just the top-level class of a type, without necessarily
> knowing all its argument types.** It is this type of runtime information thatâ€™s required for array
> creation
