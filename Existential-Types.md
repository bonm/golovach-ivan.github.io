# Existential Types in Scala

## Java intro
## Java Wildcards
> ... by means of a novel notion of **wildcard capture**, polymorphic methods can be used to give symbolic names 
> to unspecified types, in a manner similar to the **“open” construct** known from existential types.

> The decision to include parametric polymorphism – also known as genericity or generics – 
> in the Java programming language was preceded by a long academic debate. ... It became increasingly clear 
> that the mechanism on its own, imported as it were from a functional context, lacked some of 
> the flexibility associated with object-oriented subtype polymorphism.

> ... an approach by Thorup and Torgersen [30], which we shall refer to as use-site variance, seems
> particularly successful in mediating between the two types of polymorphism without imposing penalties on other parts
> of the language. The approach was later developed, formalized, and proven type sound by Igarashi and Viroli [17]
> within the Featherweight GJ calculus [15].
