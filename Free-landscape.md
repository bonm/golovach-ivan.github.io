- What if Free Monad? Is it like Reader/State/Writer/parser/... ?

## Universal Algebra: Free Objects

# Algebra / Free Algebraic Structure
## Free Magma
[Free magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma_(algebra)#Free_magma):
> A free magma, Mx, on a set, X, is the "most general possible" magma generated by X 
> (i.e., there are no relations or axioms imposed on the generators; see free object). 
> It can be described as the set of non-associative words on X with parentheses retained

> It can also be viewed, in terms familiar in computer science, as the magma of binary 
> trees with leaves labelled by elements of X. The operation is that of joining trees at the root.

## Free Monoid

## Free Boolean Algebra
[Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra_(structure))
and
[Free Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Boolean_algebra)
> In mathematics, a free Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra with a distinguished set of elements, called generators, such that:
> 1. Each element of the Boolean algebra can be expressed as a finite combination of generators, using the Boolean operations, and
> 2. The generators are as independent as possible, in the sense that there are no relationships among them (again in terms of finite expressions using the Boolean operations) that do not hold in every Boolean algebra no matter which elements are chosen.

# Category Theory
## Free Functor

#### Yoneda lemma / Yoneda / Coyoneda
#### Left/Right kan extension

cats.free.Coyoneda / scalaz.Coyoneda

> The free functor on `F`. This is isomorphic to `F` as long as `F` itself is a functor.
> The function/homomorphism from `F[A]` to `Coyoneda[F,A]` exists even when `F` is not a functor.
